# Heaven's Door

A tiny Rails engine that generates capybara test scenario by recording browser operation in development env.


## Installation

Add this line to your Rails application's Gemfile (in most cases, for development group only):

```ruby
gem 'heavens_door', group: :development
```

Enable running of unsafe scripts via Application Controller

```ruby
content_security_policy false
```

> Please not this code should _not_ be committed and be left in place only when generating test scripts in development mode. If this code is pushed to production it will open out your site to attacks.


## Usage

Your operations will be recorded on the browser.

### Copy to Clipboard
You can export the operations as a Capybara test scenario script by clicking the üìã button.

### Stop Recording
To stop recording and clear the whole recorded scenario, click the ‚èπ button.
